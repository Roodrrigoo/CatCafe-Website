This project leverages the following technologies to offer a friendly and functional interface:

- **HTML**: Used to structure the content of the page in a semantic and accessible way.
- **CSS**: Applied to style the page, selecting colors, fonts, and layout to provide an attractive user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the page, allowing users to perform dynamic actions such as navigating the menu and placing orders.
- **APIs**: Integrated APIs enrich the functionality of the site, allowing real-time menu updates and interaction with external platforms.
- **MySQL**: Utilized for storing and managing the café menu information, ensuring the data is up to date for both users and the site administrator.

## Features

- **Menu Navigation**: Users can easily browse through the café's menu using the dynamic interface.
